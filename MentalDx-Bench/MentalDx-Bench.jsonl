The patient began experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices out of nowhere), frequently talking to himself, feeling that people around him were commenting about him, believing that everyone was paying attention to him, thinking that the school had installed surveillance cameras to monitor him, and believing that others could know his inner thoughts even without him speaking. He felt that he had special abilities, such as being able to hear conversations from a far distance, believed he was a key student being developed by his teachers, and thought he could get admitted into ****** University (normally very self-confident). His suspiciousness markedly increased, suspecting his mother of revealing his privacy to classmates, treating everyone as potential enemies, not acknowledging being ill, and requesting hospitalization to prove his mental health.

Nighttime sleep was poor, with difficulty falling asleep, and occasionally he would wake up in the middle of the night with profuse sweating. Emotional fluctuations occurred easily, including increased irritability and anxiety, reduced social interactions, and occasional weakness in both legs. He was unable to perform at work, self-reporting frequent forgetting of details due to memory problems, which affected his job performance. Recent memory has significantly deteriorated, making it difficult to persist at work. Three months ago, he sought symptomatic and supportive treatment at the local hospital to improve memory issues, but relief was not significant. Later, he visited our hospital, where potential memory and cognitive difficulties were initially considered. Over two months ago, the above memory issues worsened again, with the decline in memory severely affecting daily activities, and thus he was admitted to our hospital today for further evaluation.\n3.

Thought content was centered around the traumatic event with frequent suspicion or fear of persecution. General knowledge, judgment, comprehension, and memory were normal.

Two months ago, he lost recognition of his own identity and repeatedly insisted during interviews that he was Japanese, providing detailed descriptions of childhood wandering and adoption experiences. These episodes were accompanied by repeated stereotypical behaviors, such as persistently speaking the same short phrase to himself and gently shaking his head for up to three minutes; the patient later stated that these actions were beyond his control.

He frequently beat and verbally abused her at home, expressing suspicion towards her. Over 10 hours prior to admission, after failing to reach the patient by phone, the husband again suspected her of contact with the colleague and assaulted her at home. During an episode of intense agitation, the patient picked up a perfume bottle from the table and struck her own head, then sat on the sofa crying, suddenly entering a dazed state, with fixed and repetitive behavior such as tightly holding a quilt and repeatedly shouting \"Where is my child?\". She exhibited identity confusion, repeatedly referring to herself in childhood roles, displayed childlike rocking movements, and was unable to correctly identify her own surname or name, and no longer recognized her husband's true identity in daily life. The family called for emergency help and sent her to an outside hospital, where partial relief was achieved after diazepam injection; she was able to recognize people but selectively ignored environmental stimuli, focusing only on imaginary scenes with the quilt. After debridement, suturing, and cranial CT at the outside hospital to exclude intracranial hemorrhage, the patient was transferred to my department.\nFurther medical history inquiry revealed denial of seizures, nausea, vomiting, hemiplegia, or other discomforts. No history of hypertension or diabetes was reported.\nPhysical examination showed the patient in a state of selective attention, with occasional delayed responses to questions. Orientation was mostly correct but limited to responding to specific cues. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, considered secondary to stress response. Heart, lungs, and abdomen showed no positive findings; scalp laceration had been treated.\nPsychiatric evaluation found attention limited to personal items such as the quilt, refusal to accept her actual identity, slow but coherent answers, appropriately dressed but with monotonous speech and behavior, repeatedly engaged in doll play, with no hallucinations, illusions, or misidentifications.

In the past 2 years, behavioral issues have become more apparent, along with poor motor control, such as unsteady gait and frequent bumping into objects. This led to a visit to ****** Air Force Hospital in ******, where electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no remarkable findings.

Three months ago, impairments in daily activities worsened, including pushing tables and self-injury, and the patient visited ****** Children's Hospital for re-evaluation that focused on motor dysfunction.

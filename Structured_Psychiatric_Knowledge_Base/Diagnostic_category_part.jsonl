{"diagnostic_category": "Neurodevelopmental disorders", "code_list": ["6A00", "6A01", "6A02", "6A03", "6A04", "6A05", "6A06"], "Definition": "- Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of mental or behavioral disorders that arise during the developmental period of an individual. These disorders typically manifest early, particularly in the preschool years, and are characterized by developmental deficits that result in impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning.\n- The core features of these disorders include significant difficulties in acquiring and executing specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions. Although many mental and behavioral disorders may emerge during the developmental period, only those in which neurodevelopmental impairment is the central characteristic are classified within this group."}
